I think one of them may have missed it. - Has the picture started? - Two minutes ago. That's it. Forget it. I can't go in. - Two minutes. - We've blown it already. I can't go in, in the middle. In the middle? We've only missed the titles. They're in Swedish. You want to get coffee for two hours? - Two hours? No. I'm going in. - Go ahead. Good-bye. While we're talking, we could be inside. Can we not argue in front of everybody? I get embarrassed. - All right. So what do you want to do? - I don't know. Go to another movie? - Let's see The Sorrow and the Pity. - We've seen it.

11," That's a polite word for where you are. We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday. It is not one of his best. He lacks a cohesive structure. You get the feeling that he's not absolutely sure what it is he wants to say. Of course, I've always felt he was essentially a technical filmmaker. Granted, La Strada was a great film. Great in its use of negative imagery more than anything else. But that central cohesive core... Stop listening to him. I'm screaming his opinions in my ear. Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyarakan. I found it incredibly indulgent. He really is. He's one of the most indulgent filmmakers. The key word here is indulgent. Without getting... What are you depressed about? I missed my therapy. I overslept. How can you possibly oversleep? The alarm clock. Do you know what a hostile gesture that is to me? I know. Because of our sexual problem, right? Everybody online at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse. It's like Samuel Beckett. I admire the technique, but it doesn't hit me on a gut level. I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level. Stop it, Albie. He's spitting on my neck. The most important thing of all... And you know something else? If I miss my therapy, you can only think of it in terms of how it affects you. It's felt unshown. It's probably on their first date, right? They probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. A 30-ish academic wishes to meet a woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy. What do you mean, our sexual problem? I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn. I'm very sorry. My sexual problem. Okay, my sexual problem. I've never read that. That was a Henry James novel. The sequel to Turn of the Screw. It's the influence of television. Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a high intensity, you understand? A hot medium. What I wouldn't give for a large sock with horse manure in it. What do you do when you get stuck on a movie line with a guy like this behind you? Why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country. He can give you. Do you have to give it so loud? Do you have to give him to pontificate like that? The funny part is, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's work. Really? I happened to teach a class at Columbia called TV, Media and Culture. I think my insights into Mr. McLuhan will have a great deal of validity. Do you? That's funny because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So, yeah, just let me... Come over here a second. Tell her. I heard what you were saying. You're not going to be happy with any of my work. You mean my whole fallacy is wrong. How you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing. Boy, if life were only like this... June 14, 1940. The German army occupies Paris. All over the country, people are desperate for every available scrap of wood. Boy, those guys in the French Resistance are really brave, you know? I'm sorry I'm missing so much. I know. Sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture. You? You kidding? The Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card and you'd tell them everything. That movie makes me feel guilty. Well, because it's supposed to. I mean, I... What? What's the matter? I don't... It's not natural. We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time. You know, I mean, I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice. It's only some kind of an excuse. You used to think that I was very sexy. When we first started going out, we had sex constantly. We're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records. Well, Albie, it'll pass. It'll pass. It's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all. I mean, you've been married before. You know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first. I mean, you know that you're on right after Chris Brown, which looks about 20 minutes, something like that. Excuse me. When do I go on? Who are you? Albie Singer. I'm a comedian. Oh, comedian. Yeah. Oh, uh, you're on next? What do you mean, next? I mean, you're on right after this act. No, it can't be, because he's a comic. Yes. So what are you telling me? You're putting on two comics in a row? Why not? No, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna... I can't... I don't want to go on after another comedian. It's okay. No, because they're laughing. So I'd rather not. Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you. I know. I'd prefer not to, because, look, they're laughing at him, see? So what are you telling me, that they're gonna laugh at him for a couple of minutes, and I gotta go out there, I gotta get laughs too? How much can they laugh? They're laughed out. Do you feel all right? Jesus. What's your name? Allison. Yeah? Allison what? Porchnik. Porchnik? Nice. Thanks. So, uh, what are you telling me? You work for Stevenson all the time, or what? No, no, no, I'm in the midst of doing my thesis. On what? A political commitment in 20th century literature. You like New York Jewish left-wing liberal intellectuals, Central Park West, Brandeis University, the socialist summer camps, and the father with the Ben Shahn drawings, right? And they're really, you know, strike-oriented, kind of, um, stop me before I make a complete imbecile of myself. No, that was wonderful. I love being reduced to a cultural stereotype. Right, I'm a big, you know, but for the left, for the left. I have to go out there. Say something encouraging, quickly. I think you're cute. Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead. I don't know why they would have me at this kind of rally, because excuse me, I'm not essentially a political comedian at all. I, interestingly, had dated a woman in the Eisenhower administration briefly, and it was ironic to me, because um, because I was trying to do to her what Eisenhower's been doing to the country for the last eight years. I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because I can't get it off my mind, Allison, it's obsessing me. Oh, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention. But it doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository, and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense. How's he? I'll tell you this. He was not marksman enough to hit a moving target at that range, but if there was a second assassin, that's it. We've been through this. They recovered the shells from that rifle. All right, then what are you saying now? That everybody on the Warren commission is in on this conspiracy, right? Well, why not? Yeah, Earl Warren? Hey, honey, I don't know Earl Warren. Lyndon Johnson? Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have. It's like a notch underneath child molester. Then everybody's in on the conspiracy. The FBI and the CIA and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies in the Pentagon and the men's room attendant at the White House. I would leave out the men's room attendant. You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me. Oh, my God. She's right. Why did I turn off Alice in Portsnick? She was beautiful, she was willing, she was real intelligent. Is it the old Graf Joe Marks joke that I'm I just don't want to belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member Albie, now don't panic, please. I told you it's a mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house. Stop it. Don't do that. Go to that one there. Maybe we should just call the police. It's all 9-1-1. It's the lobster squad. Come on, Albie. They're only baby ones, for God's sake. If they're only babies, then you pick them up. Oh, all right, all right. All right. Here. Here you go. Don't give it to me. Don't. Look, one call behind the refrigerator it'll turn up in our bed at night. Get out of here with that thing. Get out of here with that thing. Jesus. Get it. Talk to him. You speak shellfish. Hey, look. Put it in the pot. I can't. I can't put it in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water. What do you think we're going to do? Take it to the movies? Here you go. Oh, good, Albie. Oh, thank you. Ah! Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the hot. Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it'll run out the other side. I'm going to get my camera. Hold on. You know, I think if I could pry before... We should have gotten steaks because they don't have legs. They don't run around. Ah! Jesus! Jesus! All right. All right. Here, pick this lobster up. Hold it, please. It'll bake great. You're going to take pictures now? Albie, it'll be wonderful. Oh, lovely! Oh, God. That's disgusting. One more, Ellie, please. One more, please. Oh, good! So here's what I want to know. Was I your first big romance? Oh, no, no, no. Really? Who was? Oh, well, let's see. There was Dennis from Chippewa Falls High School. Dennis, right? Local kid, probably. We meet in front of the movie house on Saturday night. Oh, God. You should have seen what I looked like then. I can imagine. Probably the wife of an astronaut. Then there was Jerry, the actor.","It lacks a cohesive structure. You get the feeling he's not absolutely sure what it is he wants to say. I've always felt he was essentially a technical filmmaker. Granted La Strada was a great film. Great in its use of negative imagery more than anything else. - I'm going to have a stroke. - Stop listening to him. He's screaming his opinions in my ear. All that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon. I found it incredibly indulgent. He really is one of the most indulgent of filmmakers. Key word here is indulgent. - What are you depressed about? - I missed my therapy. I overslept. How can you possibly oversleep? The alarm clock. You know what a hostile gesture that is to me? I know. Because of our sexual problem, right? Everybody in line has to know our rate of intercourse? It's like Samuel Beckett. I admire the technique, but it doesn't hit me on a gut level. - I'd like to hit him on a gut level. - Stop it. He's spitting on my neck when he talks. You know something else? You're so egocentric that... if I miss my therapy you can only think of it in terms of how it affects you! They're probably on their first date. Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman... who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy. What do you mean our sexual problem? I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn. I'm sorry. My sexual problem. Okay? My sexual problem! I never read that. That was Henry James' sequel to Turn of the Screw? It's the influence of television. Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a high intensity. Do you understand? A hot medium. What I wouldn't give for a large sock with horse manure in it. What do you do when you get stuck on a movie line with a guy like this? Wait. Why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country! He can. Do you have to give it so loud? Aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? The funny part is, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan. I happen to teach a class at Columbia called TV, Media and Culture. I think my insights into Mr. McLuhan have a great deal of validity. Do you? That's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. Just let me... Come over here. Tell him. I heard what you were saying. You know nothing of my work. You mean my whole fallacy is wrong. How you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing! If life were only like this. June 14, 1940. The German army occupies Paris. All over the country, people are desperate for food. Those guys in the French Resistance were really brave. To have to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much. I know. Sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture. You? You kidding? The Gestapo would take away your charge card, and you'd tell 'em everything. That movie makes me feel guilty. It's supposed to. - Alvy, I... - What? What's the matter? It's not natural. We're sleeping in a bed together. It's been a long time! It's just, I mean... I've got to sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice. It's always some kind of an excuse. You used to think I was very sexy. When we first started going out, we had sex constantly. We're probably listed in The Guinness Book of World Records. It'll pass. I'm going through a phase, that's all. You've been married before. You know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first. You were very hot for Allison at first. You know that you're on right after Chris Brown, in about 20 minutes. Excuse me. When do I go on? Who are you? Alvy Singer. - I'm the comedian. - Oh, comedian. Oh, you're on next. What do you mean next? You're on right after this act. - It can't be, because he's a comic. - Yes. - You're putting on two comics in a row? - Why not? No, I'm sorry. I'm not going to go on after another comedian. - It's okay. - No. They're laughing. I'd rather not. Will you relax, please? They're going to love you. I know. I prefer not to. Look, they're laughing at him. What are you telling me? They'll laugh at him a few minutes. Then I've got to get laughs, too. How much can they laugh? - They're laughed out. - Do you feel all right? Jesus. - What's your name? - Allison. Yeah? Allison what? Portchnik. - Portchnik? That's nice. - Thank you. So, you work for Stevenson all the time? - No. I'm doing my thesis. - On what? Political commitment in 20th-century literature. You're like New York Jewish, left-wing, intellectual... Central Park West, Brandeis University, socialist summer camps... and the father with the Ben Shahn drawings... really strike-oriented... Stop me before I make a complete imbecile of myself. That was wonderful! I love being reduced to a cultural stereotype. Right. I'm a bigot, but for the left. I have to go out there. Say something encouraging, quickly. - I think you're cute. - Yeah? Do you? Go ahead. I don't know why they would have me at this kind of rally... 'cause I'm not essentially a political comedian. I interestingly had dated a woman... in the Eisenhower administration, briefly. It was ironic to me... 'cause I was trying to do to her... what Eisenhower's been doing to the country for the last eight years. I'm sorry. I can't go through with this. I can't get it off my mind! It's obsessing me! I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention. But it doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository... and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound.

Edgar Hoover, the oil companies... the Pentagon, the men's-room attendant at the White House? I would leave out the men's-room attendant. You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me. Oh, my God! She's right. Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was beautiful. She was willing. She was real intelligent. Is it the old Groucho Marx joke... that I don't want to belong to any club that would have me for a member? - Alvy, don't panic! - It's a mistake... to bring a live thing in the house. Don't do that. Maybe we should call the police. Dial 911. It's the lobster squad. They're only baby ones. For God sakes. - If they're babies, you pick them up. - All right! All right! - Here you go! - Don't give it to me. Look! One crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night. Get out of here with that thing! Talk to him. You speak shellfish. Hey, put it in the pot. I can't. I can't put a live thing in hot water. What d'you think we were going to do, take him to the movies? Good. Oh, thank you. Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot. Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a dish of butter sauce here, it'll run out the other side. I'm going to get my camera.

Alvy, it'll be wonderful. Oh, lovely! - It's disgusting. - One more, please? One more. Good! Here's what I want to know. Am I your first, big romance? - Who was? - There was Dennis from high school. Local kid who'd meet you in front of the movie house on Saturday night? - You should've seen how I looked then. - I can imagine. An astronaut's wife. - Then there was Jerry, the actor. - Look at you. You're such a clown. - I look pretty. - You always do. But that guy with you!"
12," Look at you. You're such a clown. I look pretty. You always look pretty, but that guy with you... Acting is like an exploration of the soul. It's very religious. Like a kind of liberating consciousness. It's like a visual poem. Is he kidding with that crap? Oh, right. Right. I think I know exactly what you mean when you say religious. You do? Come on. I mean, I was younger. Hey, that was last year. It's like when I think of dying. You know how I'd like to die? No. How? I'd like to get torn apart by wild animals. I'm heavy, eaten by some squirrels. Hey, listen. I mean, he was a terrific actor. Look at him. He's neat-looking and he was emotional. Hey, I don't think you like emotion too much. Touch my heart with your foot. I may throw up. He was creepy. Yeah. I think you're pretty lucky I came alone. Oh, really? Well, la-di-da. La-di-da. If anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like la-di-da. Oh, that's right. You really like those New York girls. Well, no. Not just. Not only. Oh, I'd say so. You married two of them. Here's Henry Drucker. He has a chair in history at Princeton. And the short man is Herschel Kaminsky. He has a chair in philosophy at Cornell. Yeah. Two more chairs. They got a dining room set. Why are you so hostile? Because I want to watch the Knicks on television. Is that Paul Goodman? No. Be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug. Douglas Wyeth. The foul rag and bone chop of the heart. I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for dysentery. Commentary. Really? I'd heard that commentary and dissent had merged and formed dysentery. No jokes. These are friends, okay? Cleveland Cavaliers losing to the Outfitted New York Knicks. Here you are. There's people out there. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead 14 points, so now they're ahead two points. Albie, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stop a ball through a hoop? What is fascinating is that it's physical. It's one thing about intellectuals. They prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand, the body doesn't lie. As we now know. Stop acting out. It'll be great, because all those PhDs are in there discussing modes of alienation, and we'll be in here quietly humping. Albie, don't. You're using sex to express hostility. Why do you always reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories? He said as he removed her brassiere... Albie, there are people out there from the New Yorker magazine. My God. What'd they think? Damn siren. Okay, don't get upset. Damn it, I was so close. Jesus, last night there was a guy hocking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. What do you want me to do? Have him shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex? I'm too tense. I need a valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York. We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. You got crickets and it's quiet. There's no place to walk after dinner, and there's the screens with the dead morphs behind them, and you got the Manson family, possibly, and you got Dick and Perry. Okay, okay. My analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn valium? It's quiet now. We can just start again. I can't. My head is throbbing. Oh, you got a headache? I have a headache. Bad? Like Oswald in Ghosts. Jesus. Where are you going? I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers. Max, my server's gonna send you to the showers early. Right, right. So to get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is anti-Semitism. Max, the city is terribly wrong. But I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin. No, no, no, Max. That's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you, it's because of anti-Semitism. Don't you see the rest of the country looks upon New York like we're left-wing communist Jewish homosexual pornographers? I think of us that way sometimes, and I live here. Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day in the sun. Sun is bad for you. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college. I know, but I... Oh, he got... Here he comes. Okay. Oh, hi. Ready? Hi. Oh, hi, Albie. How are you? This is Ernie Hall. Hi. Hi, Albie. Just playing with hooker. Uh, you and me again, Sam? Oh, I... I'm not so fair. I'm just playing hooker, you know? I've had four lessons. Oh, yes. Hi. Hi. Hi. Oh, hi. Hi. Well... Bye. You... You play very well. Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, what a... What a dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say you play well, and then right away, I have to say you play well. Oh, oh, God, Annie. Well... Oh, well. Ha-ha. La-di-da, la-di-da, la-la. Yeah. Uh, you... You want a lift? Oh, why? Uh... You got a car? Me? No, I'm... I was gonna take a cab. Oh, no, I have a car. You have a car? So, I don't understand. If you have a car, so then why did you say, do you have a car like you want a lift? I don't... I don't... I... Jeez, I don't know. I wasn't... It's... It's... It's... I got this VW out there. I don't... What a jerk. Yeah. Would you like a lift? Sure. Which way are you going? Me? Um, downtown. Down... I'm going uptown. Oh, well, you know I'm going uptown, too. You just said you were going downtown. Yeah, well, but I can... Sorry. I can go uptown, too. I live uptown. But what the hell? It'd be nice having company. I mean, I hate driving alone. Yeah? So, how long do you know Jana? Where do you know her from? Oh, I'm an interactivist. Oh, you're an actress. Well, I do commercial sort of, you know. You don't watch the road? I, uh... Well, you're not from New York, right? Oh, it's a guapal. Right. Where? West Concert. You're driving a tad rapidly. Don't worry. I'm a very good driver. Thank you. So, listen, hey, you want some gum anyway? No, no thanks. Hey, don't do that. No, no, no, no. Would you... Would you watch the road? I'll get it. I'll get your piece. So, listen, you drive? Do I drive? No, I got a problem with driving. Oh, you do? Yeah. I got a license, but I have too much hostility. Oh, right. Nice car. Keep it nice. Can I ask you, is this a sandwich? Oh, yeah. I live over here. Oh, my God. Look, there's a parking space. Oh, my God. That's okay. We can walk to the curb from here. Okay. It'll be fine. You want your tennis stuff? Huh? You want your gear? Oh, yeah. That's good. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Well... Thank you. Thank you. You're a wonderful tennis player. Oh. You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life. That's any place, the worst. Europe, you know, any place. Asia. Yeah. And I love what you're wearing. Oh, you do? Yeah. Oh, well, it's a... This tie is a present from Grammy Hall. Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall? Yeah, my Grammy. What are you... What did you do? Grew up in a Norman Rockwell painting? Yeah, I know. Your Grammy? I know. It's pretty silly. She said my Grammy never gave gifts, you know. She was too busy getting raped by Cossacks. Well... Thank you again. Oh, yeah. Hey, well, listen, hey, you want to come upstairs? And then have a glass of wine or something? No, I know. I mean, you don't have to. You're probably late and everything. No, no, that'll be fine. I'll... Never mind. Sure. Sure. No, I got time. I got... Sure. I got nothing... Do I? Nothing to my analyst appointment. Oh, what? You see an analyst? Yeah, just for 15 years. 15 years? I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm going to Lourdes. 15? Nah, come on. Yeah? Really? Sylvia Plath, interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic by the college girl mentality. Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry. Right. Well, I don't know. I mean, some of her poems seem neat. Neat? I hate to tell you. This is 1975, you know. The neat went out, I would say, at the turn of the century. Who are those photos on the wall? Oh, oh, well, you see, now... Now, that's my dad. That's father. And that's my brother, Dwayne. Dwayne? Yeah, right. Dwayne. And over there is Grammy Hall. And that's Sadie. Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie. Sadie met Grammy through Grammy's brother George. George was real sweet, you know. He had that thing... What is that thing where you, um... Where you fall asleep in the middle of a sentence? You know, what is it? Uh, narcolepsy. Narcolepsy, right, right. Right, so anyway, so, um... George went to the Union, you see, to get his free turkey because the Union was going to be a big party.","Like a kind of liberating consciousness. It's like a visual poem. Is he kidding with that crap? Oh, right! Right. I think I know exactly what you mean when you say religious. - You do? - Come on. I was younger. That was last year! It's like when I think of dying.

Well... bye. - You play very well. - Oh, yeah? So do you! God, what a dumb thing to say. You say You play well, and right away I have to say, You play well. Oh, God, Annie. Well. Oh, well! La-de-dah.

I'm a very good driver. - You want some gum? - No, thanks. - Where is it? - Don't do that. No, no, watch the road. I'll get it. Concentrate, will ya? - I'll get you a piece. - Listen. You drive? Do I drive? No, I got a problem with driving. - You do? - Yeah. I got a license, but I have too much hostility. Nice car. You keep it nice. - Can I ask you, is this a sandwich? - Oh, yeah.

Well. Well. - Thank you. - Thank you. You're a wonderful tennis player... and you're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life. Anyplace. Europe. Anyplace. Asia. - I love what you're wearing. - You do? Yeah. This tie is a present from Grammy Hall. Who? Grammy Hall? Yeah, my grammy. What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting? Your grammy? - It's pretty silly, isn't it? - My grammy never gave gifts. She was too busy getting raped by Cossacks. Well, thank you again. Oh, yeah. Listen. You want to come upstairs and have a glass of wine or something? No, I mean you don't have to. You're probably late and everything. No, that would be fine. I wouldn't mind. Sure. I got time. I got nothing until my analyst appointment. You see an analyst? - Just for 15 years. - 15 years? I'm going to give him one more year, and then I'm going to Lourdes. 15? Nah, come on! Yeah? Really? Sylvia Plath. Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide... was misinterpreted as romantic by the college-girl mentality. Right. I don't know. I mean, some of her poems seem neat. Neat? I hate to tell you this is 1975. Neat went out at the turn of the century. Who are those photos on the wall? Oh, you see... that's my dad, that's Father, and that's my brother, Duane. Yeah, right. And over there's Grammy Hall. - And that's Sadie. - Who's Sadie? Well, Sadie met Grammy through Grammy's brother, George. George was real sweet. He had that thing. What is that thing where you fall asleep in the middle of a sentence? - Narcolepsy. - Right. So anyway, George went to the union to get his free turkey... because the union always gave George this free turkey at Christmastime... because he was shell-shocked in the first World War."
13," The union always gave George this free turkey at Christmas time because he was shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War? Anyway, so George is standing in line, oh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is that he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So he's dead. He's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty awful, I can... It's a great story, though. I mean, I really made my day. Hey, I think I should get out of here, you know, because I think I'm imposing, you know, and... Oh, well, maybe... You know, I... Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know. No, I know, but I'm all perspired and everything. Well, didn't you take a shower at the club? I mean, no, no, no, because I never shower in a public place. Why not? Because I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know. Oh, I see, I see. You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender. Yeah, I see, I guess. You never know what's gonna happen. 15 years, huh? 15 years, yeah. Oh. God bless. Ha! Well, yeah. You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew. Thank you. Yeah, well, she hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, and she's the one, man, is she ever, I'm telling you. So did you do those photographs in there or what? Yeah, yeah, I sort of dabble around, you know. They're wonderful. You know, they have a quality. Well, I would like to take a serious photography course. Photography's interesting, because it's a new art form and a set of aesthetic criteria have not emerged yet. Aesthetic criteria? You mean whether it's a good photo or not? The medium enters in as a condition of the art form itself. Well, well, to me, I mean, it's all instinctive. You know, I mean, I just try to feel it, you know. I try to get a sense of it and not think about it so much. Still, you need a set of aesthetic guidelines to put it in social perspective, I think. Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess you must be sort of late, huh? You know, I've got to get there and begin whining soon. Are you busy Friday night? Me? Oh, uh, no. Oh, I'm sorry. Wait a minute. I have something. What about Saturday night? Oh, nothing. No, no. You're very popular, I can see. I know. What do you have? You have plague? Well, I mean, I mean a lot of jerks. I mean a lot of jerks, too. But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know. Oh, wait a second. Oh, no, no. Oh, shoot. Saturday night, I'm gonna... I'm gonna sing. You're gonna sing? Do you sing? No kidding. This is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm interested. I'm auditioning sort of at this club. No, it's my first time. That's okay, because I know exactly what that's like. Listen, you're gonna like nightclubs. They're really a lot of fun. It had to be you It had to be you I wandered around And finally found There's somebody Who Could make me be true Could make me be rude And even be glad Just to be sad Thinking of you It is mine. I really told you a lie. I was awful. I'm so ashamed. I can't think. The audience was a tad restless. What do you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, they hated me. No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice. No, I'm gonna quit. I'm not gonna let you. You have a great voice. Really? Do you think so? Yeah. Yeah? It's terrific. You know something? I never even took a lesson. Hey, listen. Give me a kiss. Really? Yeah, why not? We're just gonna go home later. There's gonna be all that tension. We never kissed before. We'll kiss now. We'll get it over with. Then we'll go eat. We'll digest our food better. Okay? So now we can digest our food. I'm gonna have a corned beef. Oh, I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce. So, um, your second wife left you, and we depressed about that? Nothing. A few mega vitamins couldn't cure. And your first wife? Allison? Yeah, she was nice, but that was my fault. I was too crazy. That was so nice. That was nice. As Balzac said, there goes another novel. Geez, you were great. Oh, yeah? Yeah? Yeah, I'm correct. You're a wreck. I mean it. I will never play the piano again. It was... I don't know. You really thought it was good? Good, yes. No. That was the most fun I've ever had without laughing. Here, you want some? No, no, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff about five years ago at a party and I tried to take my pants off over my head for about one year. Well, I don't know. I don't do it very often. It just sort of relaxes me. Yes. Mm-hmm. You're not going to believe this, but... Boy. Hey. I'm going to buy you these books, I think, because I think you should read them, instead of that cat book. That's pretty serious stuff there. Yeah, because I'm obsessed with death, I think. It's a big subject with me. I have a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're going to go out. I feel that life is divided up between the miserable and the miserable. Those are the two categories. The horrible would be like, I don't know, terminal cases and blind people and cripples. I don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me. And the miserable is everyone else. So when you go through life, you should be thankful that you're miserable because you're very lucky to be miserable. Look at that guy. There's Mr. in pink, Mr. Miami Beach there. He's the latest. Just come back from the gin rummy finals. Look at these guys. They're back from Fire Island. They're sort of giving it a chance. Italian, right? Him? Yeah, he's the mafia. Linen supply business or cement and contracting. Oh, gee. Just like my mustache wax. There's the winner of the Truman Capote Look-A-Like Contest. You are extremely sexy, unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because you're polymorphously perverse. What does that mean? I don't know what that is. You're exceptional in bed because you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch it, you know what I mean? Like the tip of your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps, you suddenly get excited. You know what? You know I like you. I really do like you. Do you love me? That's the key question. I know you've only known me a short while. I think that's sort of it. Yeah. Yeah. Do you love me? I mean, love is too weak a word for... I love you. You know, I loathe you. I love you. No, you don't. With two Fs, yes. I have to invent... Of course I... Don't you think I do? I don't know. What do you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you? Of course. Yeah, but why? Well, I'm gonna move with you, that's why. Yeah, but you got a nice apartment. I know it's small. That's right. It's got bad plumbing and bugs. All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are... Entomology is a rapidly growing field. You don't want me to live with you. I don't want you to live with me. Whose idea was it? Mine. Yeah. It was yours, actually, but I approved it immediately. I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? No, what... We live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do you? How is it any different? It's different because you keep your own apartment. Because, you know, it's there. We don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a free-floating life raft that we know that we're not married. That little apartment is $400 a month, Albie. That place is $400 a month? Yes, it is. It's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus. My accountant will write off as a tax deduction. I'll pay for it. You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about? Hey, don't be ridiculous. Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something? Because adult education is a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing.","getting his free turkey... but the thing is he falls asleep, and he never wakes up. So he's dead. He's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh? Wouldn't you say? Pretty awful. It's a great story, though. It really made my day. I think I should get out of here, 'cause I think I'm imposing. Really? Maybe... - You don't have to. - But I'm all perspired and everything. Didn't you take a shower at the club? No, no. I never shower in a public place. Why not? I don't like to get naked in front of another man. I see. I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender. - I see, I guess. - You never know what's going to happen. - 15 years, huh? - 15 years, yeah. God bless. Well! Well...

A set of aesthetic criteria have not emerged yet. I'm not smart enough for him. Hang in there. You mean whether it's a good photo or not? I don't know what I'm saying. She senses I'm shallow. The medium enters in as a condition of the art form itself. God, I hope he doesn't turn out to be a schmuck like the others. Well, to me... I mean... It's all instinctive. I just try to feel it, to get a sense of it and not think about it so much. Christ, I sound like FM radio. Relax. Still, you need aesthetic guidelines to put it in social perspective. I don't know.

You meet a lot of interesting professors. It's stimulating."
14," Education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lot of interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating. [""The Star-Spangled Banner""] Does this sound like a good course, modern American poetry? Or, let's see now, maybe I should take introduction to the novel. Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf. What? Hey, listen, what do you think? You think we should go to that party in Southampton? What do you know? Don't be silly. What do we need other people for? You know, we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide-the-salam or something. Well, okay, well, it's time to get a cigarette, okay? You know, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday. Well, have you ever made love high? Me? No, I, you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything, I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. I don't know why you have to get high every time we make love. Well, it relaxes me. Oh, you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed? Well, what's the difference anyway? Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it. Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for 15 years. You should smoke some of this. You'd be off the couch in no time. Oh, come on, you don't need that. What are you doing? Oh, no, no, no, no. You can live with that at once. Albie, come here. Oh, mm. Wait, I got a great idea. Come in there for a second. I got a little artifact, a little erotic artifact that I brought up from the city, which I think is gonna be perfect. I just, there, create a little old New Orleans essence. Now, we can go about our business here and even develop photographs if we want to. Just stay. Hey, is something wrong? No, why? I don't know. It's like you're moved. No, I'm fine. Really? Uh-huh. I don't know, you seem sort of distant. Let's just do it, all right? Was it my imagination or you're just going through the motions? Albie, do you remember where I put my drawing pad? Because while you two are doing that, I think I'm gonna do some drawing. You see, that's what I call removed. Oh, you have my body. Yeah, but that's, I want the whole thing. Well, I need grass. Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass because, you know, I'm like a comedian. So if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count, you know, because they're always laughing. Are you always funny? Hey, what is this, an interview we're supposed to be making love? This guy is naturally funny. I think he can write for you. Yeah, yeah. Hey, Kitty, tells me you're really good. Well, let me explain a little bit of how I work. You know, you can tell right off the bat that I don't look like a funny guy when I come, you know, like some of the guys that come out. You know, right away, they're gonna tell you their stories. You're gonna fall down, but I gotta be really talented. Material's gotta be sensational for me because I work, you know, with very, very, kind of, I'm kind of classy, you know what I mean? Let me explain. For instance, I'll open an opening song. The music will start like, ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, and I walk up, um-pah, the place looks wonderful from here. And you folks look wonderful from here. That seeing you there with a smile on your face makes me shout, this must be the place. I stop right in the middle, and then I open with some jokes. Now, that's where I need you right there. For instance, like I say, hey, I just got back from Canada, you know? They speak a lot of French up there. The only way to remember Jean d'Arc means the light's out in the bathroom. Oh, I'm in a big lumberjack. Jesus, this guy's pathetic. Look at him mincing around. Wait, he thinks he's real cute? Do you wanna throw up? If only I had the nerve to do my own jokes. I don't know how much longer I can keep this smile frozen on my face. I'm in the wrong business, I know it. But, um, Cherie, what will I do with this, eh? He says, oh, Marie, sometime you'll make me so mad. Oh, they scream at that. Now, write me something like that. Will you, kind of a French number, can you do it? Okay. We got one more question. We've got a question for you, which is how you are going to respond. Too early. Whooo... Miss, don't Switch. I'm dying of laughter today. And now, my good friend if you could get out and tell us how big of a problem, how to help thelung. I'll give you half an gezillion dollars. I'll pass to Cherry but I'll leave you won't finish. I won't not finish. I'll leave you won't play. I'll be hombres de hurry. We got one more question. One more. I was talking to Nia, here in this hospital to take a look at you, and then she said, if you could get me So tell why I ran. I said, yes? Yeah, I said, and when I was throwing out my mother, who's an emotionally high-strung woman, locked herself in the bathroom and took an overdose of mahjong tiles. You know, to eat them down. And, I was depressed. I don't know if it was in analysis. I, I was suicidal as a matter of fact, and would have killed myself, but I was in analysis with a strict Freudian. And if you kill yourself, they make you pay for the sessions you miss. You know, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. Alvie, Alvie, you were just great. I'm not kidding. It was, you were so clean. College audiences are wonderful. Yeah, yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of the references too. Are you? Yeah. Well, the 12 o'clock show is completely different than mine. Oh. Yeah, so sure. I'm really looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think it'll be really nice. You'll meet mother and father. Yeah, I know. They'll hate me immediately. No. Yeah. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary. Yeah. I think it's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner. We'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you. It's a nice ham this year, mom. Oh yeah. Grammy always does such a good job. Great sauce. It is. It's dynamite ham. We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Graham and I. Got some nice picture frames. We really had a good time. Anne tells us that you've been seeing a psychiatrist for 15 years. Yes, I'm making excellent progress. Pretty soon when I lie down on his couch, I won't have to wear the lobster bib. Duane and I went out to the boat basin. We were cocking holes all day. And Randolph Hunt was drunk as usual. Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you. Oh yes. I can't believe this family. Annie's mother is really beautiful. And they're talking swap meets and boat basins. And the old lady at the end of the table is a classic Jew hater. And they really look American, you know. Very healthy. They never get sick or anything. Nothing like my family. The two are like oil and water. Who needs his business? His wife has diabetes. Diabetes? Is that an excuse, diabetes? Let me tell you. A man is 50 years old and doesn't have a substantial job. Is that a reason to steal? What are you talking about? Sure, defend him. You remember her, Annie. We were in 4H. Mo Moskowitz, he had a coronary. You don't say. How do you plan to spend the holidays, Mr. Singer? We fast. Fast? No food. You know, too torn for us, Singes. What's sins? I don't understand. I'll tell you the truth. Neither do we. Albie. Hi, Dwayne. How's it going? This is my room. Oh yeah? It's terrific. Can I confess something? Can I confess something? I tell you this because as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving, on the road at night, I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast, I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion, the sound of shattering glass, flames rising out of the flowing gasoline. Right. Well, I have to go now, Dwayne, because I'm due back on the planet Earth. Don't let it be so long now. No, and look up Uncle Brillie. Okay. Oh, he is adorable. Do you think so, really? We're going to take them to the airport. No, no, Dwayne can. I haven't finished my drink. Yes, Dwayne is. I'll be right, I'll just second. I have to get the... You followed me. I can't believe it. I didn't follow you. You followed me. Why, because I was walking along a block behind you, staring at you? That's not following. Well, what is your definition of following? Following is different. I was spying. Do you realize how paranoid you are? Paranoid? I'm looking at you, you've got your arms around another guy. That is the worst kind of paranoid. Jesus, well, I didn't start out spying. I thought I'd surprise you, pick you up after school. Yeah, well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible. Remember, it's your phrase. Oh, stop it. You're having an affair with your college professor, that jerk that teaches that incredible crap-course contemporary crisis in Western man... ...s existential motifs in Russian literature. You're really close. What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation. Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about. Hey, don't knock masturbation. It's...","Does this sound like a good course: Modern American Poetry? Or, let's see... maybe I should take Introduction to the Novel. Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.

How do you plan to spend the holidays, Mrs. Singer? - We fast. - Fast? No food. You know, to atone for our sins. What sins? I don't understand. Neither do we. Hi, Duane. How's it going? - This is my room. - Oh, yeah? It's terrific. Can I confess something? I tell you this, because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me, fast. I have this impulse to turn the wheel quickly... head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion. The sound of shattering glass. The flames rising out of the flowing gasoline. Right. I have to go now, Duane, because I'm due back on the planet Earth. Don't let it be so long now. - Look up Uncle Billy, promise. - He is adorable. - You'll take them to the airport now? - No. Duane can. - I haven't finished my drink. - Yes, Duane is. I'll be right... You followed me. I can't believe it! - I didn't follow you. - You followed me! Because I was walking a block behind staring at you? That's not following. - What's your definition of following? - Following is different. I was spying. Do you realize how paranoid you are? Paranoid? I'm looking at you, and you've got your arms around another guy. That is the worst kind of paranoid! I didn't start out spying. I thought I'd surprise you, pick you up after school. You wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase. You're having an affair with your college professor! That jerk that teaches that crap course, Contemporary Crisis in Western Man. Existential Motifs in Russian Literature. You're really close. What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation. Now we're getting to a subject you know something about. Don't knock masturbation. It's sex with someone I love. We're not having an affair. He's married. He happens to think I'm neat. Are you 12 years old? That's one of your Chippewa Falls expressions."
15," I'm having sex with someone I love. We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat. Neat. There's no... What are you, 12 years old? That's one of your Chippewa Falls expressions. Who cares? Who cares? The next thing you know, I'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know, he's got his hand on your ass. You've always had hostility towards David, ever since I mentioned him. You call your teacher David? It's his name. Well, listen, I said it's a biblical name, right? What does he call you, Bathsheba? Alvy. Alvy, you're the one who never wanted to make a real commitment. You don't think I'm smart enough. We had that argument just last month, but don't you remember that day? I'm home. Oh, yeah? How'd it go? Oh, it was really weird, but she's a very nice woman. And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy. She had me sitting up. So I told her about the family and about my feelings towards men and about my relationship with my brother. And then she mentioned penis envy. Do you know about that? Me? I'm one of the few males who suffers from that. So, you know, go on. Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses towards marriage and children. And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love. Really? All this happened the first hour? Yeah. That's amazing. I've been going for 15 years. I don't have nothing like that. I told her my dream, and then I cried. You cried? I have never once cried. That's fantastic to me. I whined. I sit in my room. Anyway, Alvy, in my dream, Frank Sinatra is holding this pillow across my face, and I can't breathe. Sinatra? Yeah, it's strangling me. No kidding. Sure, because he's a singer and you're a singer. So it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It makes perfect sense. It's a perfect analytic kind of insight. She said your name was Alvy Singer. What do you mean? Me? Yeah, yeah, you, because in the dream I break Sinatra's glasses. Sinatra had glasses? You never said Sinatra had glasses. What are you saying, that I'm suffocating you? Oh, and God, Alvy, I did this really terrible thing to him, because then when he sang, it was in this real high-pitched voice. What did the doctor say? Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something, I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, is will it change my wife? Will it change your wife? Will it change my life? Yeah, but you said, will it change my wife? No, I didn't. I said, will it change my life, Alvy? You said, will it change your wife? Life, I said life. She said, will it change my wife? You heard that because you were there, so I'm not crazy. Alvy, and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough. Why do you always bring that up? Because I encourage you to take adult education courses? I think it's a wonderful thing. You meet wonderful, interesting professors. Adult education is such junk. The professors are so phony. How can you do it? I don't care what you say about David. He's a perfectly fine teacher. And what are you doing following me around for, anyway? I was following you and David. That's fine. That's fine. That's great. Well, I don't know what I did wrong. I mean, I can't believe this. Somewhere she cooled off to me. Is it something that I did? Never something you do. That's how people are. Love fades. Love fades. God, that's a depressing thought. I have to ask you a question. Don't go any further. With your wife in bed, does she need some kind of artificial stimulation like marijuana? We use a large, vibrating egg. Large, vibrating egg. Well, I ask a psychopath, I get that kind of an answer. Jesus, I... Here. You look like a very happy couple. Are you? Yeah. So how do you account for it? Uh, I'm very shallow and empty, and I have no ideas and nothing interesting to say. And I'm exactly the same way. I see. Well, that's very interesting. So you've managed to work out something, huh? Right. Oh. Well, thanks very much for talking to me. You know, even as a kid, I always went for the wrong women. I think that's my problem. When my mother took me to see Snow White, everyone fell in love with Snow White. I immediately fell for the Wicked Queen. We never have any fun anymore. How can you say that? Why not? You're always leaning on me to improve myself. You're just upset. You must be getting your period. I don't get a period. I'm a cartoon character. Can't I be upset once in a while? Max, will you forget about Annie? I know lots of women you can date. I don't want to go out with any other women. Max, I have got a girl for you. You are going to love her. She's a reporter for Rolling Stone. I think there are more people here to see the Maharishi than there were to see the Dylan concert. I covered the Dylan concert, which came with chills. Especially when he sang, She takes just like a woman, and she makes love just like a woman. Yes, she does. And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl. Up to that, I guess the most charismatic event I covered was Mick's birthday when he stonesplayed Madison Square Garden. That's great. You catch Dylan? Me? No, no. I couldn't make it. My raccoon had hepatitis. You have a raccoon? A few. The only word for this is transplendent. It's transplendent. I can think of another word. He's God. I mean, this man is God. He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment. Must be a tremendous hem. I'm a Rosicrucian myself. Are you? Yeah. I can't get with any religion that advertises and popular mechanics. Look, there's God coming out of the men's room. It's unbelievably transplendent. I was at the Stones concert in Altamont when they killed that guy, remember? Yeah, were you? I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes. I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish. No, don't be silly. You know, I'm starting to get some feeling back in my jaw now. Sex with you is really a Kafka-esque experience. Oh. Thank you. I mean, that is a compliment. I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life. Who said that? I don't know. It may have been Leopold and Loeb. PHONE RINGS Hello? Oh, hi. Uh, no. What's the matter? What? What? You sound terrible. No, what... Shrek. What kind of emergency? No, well, stay there. I'll come over right now. Just stay there. I'll come right over. What's me? Are you OK? What's the matter? Are you all right? There's a spider in the bathroom. What? There's a big, black spider in the bathroom. That's what you got me here for at 3 o'clock in the morning because there's a spider in the bathroom? Oh, my God. I mean, you know how I'm about insects. I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom. Just kill it. For God... What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house? No. I told you a thousand times you should always keep a lot of insect spray. You never know who's going to crawl over. I know, I know. And a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher. All right, give me a magazine, because I'm a little tired. You know, you joke with them about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything, an emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? Did you go to a rock concert? Yeah. Oh, yeah? Really? Really? How'd you like it? Was it... I mean, was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-osity? It was just great. Oh, I got a wonderful idea. Why don't you get the guy that took you to the rock concert and call him and he can come over and kill the spider? You know, it's a... I called you. You want to help me or not, huh? What is this? Since when do you read the National Review? What are you turning into? Well, I like to try to get all points of view. Wonderful. Then why don't you get William F. Buckley to kill the spider? Alzie, you're a little hostile. You know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired. Well, I was in... It's 3 o'clock in the morning. You got me out of bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency. I ran up the stairs. I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Are you going with a right-wing rock and roll star? Would you like a glass of chocolate milk? Hey, what am I, your son? What do you mean? I came over for a... I got the good chocolate. I'm really about... Where's the spider? It's in the bathroom. Okay. Hey, don't squish it. After it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple of times. Darling, I've been killing spiders since I was 30, okay? It's a very big spider. Yeah? Yeah, a lot of trouble. There's two of them. Two? Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a... Oh, I... A snow shovel. It's at your house. I think I left it there. What are you doing? What are you doing? Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick. Okay. Hey. What is this? You got black soap? It's for my complexion. What are you joining a minstrel show? Don't worry. I did it. I killed them both. What's the matter? What are you sad about? What do you want me to do? Capture them and rehabilitate them? Oh, don't go, okay? Please? What do you mean, don't go? What's the matter? What, are you expecting termites? What's the matter with that?","Next he'll find you're keen and peachy. Then he'll have his hand on your ass.

16," I don't know, I miss you. Oh, Jesus, really? Oh, yeah. Oh. Alvie? What? Was there somebody in your room when I called you? What do you mean? I mean, was there another, I thought I heard a voice. No, I had the radio on. Yeah? I'm sorry, the television, there was a television, I was watching, you know, that shit. Yeah. Alvie, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart. You know, I think we're both much too mature for something like that. Living together hasn't been so bad, has it? No, for me it's been terrific, you know? Better than either one of my marriages, you know? Because this is just something different about you. I don't know why it is, but it's great. I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard, but it's, yeah. Alvie, what if we go away this weekend? Why don't we get Rob and the neighbors who drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood? That'd be fun for you, you think so? Yeah, I love it, yeah, I love it. Help me, my God, it's a great day! Hey, you watch the road! I watch the road, stop! Stop, total the whole car! Hey, you know, I never even been to Brooklyn before. I can't wait to see the old neighborhood. Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great. We could show her the schoolyard. Right, I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard. Yes, I remember. He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it. Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot. Oh, look, look, that's my old house. That's where I used to live. Holy cow! You're lucky, Max, where I used to live is now a pornographic equipment store. I had some very good memories there. What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time. Yeah, and we always over the most ridiculous things. You're fired the cleaning woman? She was stealing! But she's colored! So? So the colored have enough trouble! She was going through my pocketbook! They're persecuted enough! Who's persecuting? She stole! All right, so? We can afford it? How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more? She's a colored woman from Harlem. She has no money! She's got a right to steal from us. After all, who is she gonna steal from, if not us? You're both crazy. I can't hear you, Max. Leo, I married a fool! Hey, Max, what's that? That's the welcome home party, 1945, before my cousin heard me. Look, there's that over there. That's Joey Nichols. He was my father's friend. He was always bothering me when I was a kid. Joey Nichols. You see? Nichols. See? Nichols. You see? Nichols. You can always remember my name. Just think of Joey Five Cents. That's me. Joey Five Cents. What a hassle. The one who killed me the most was my mother's sister, Tessie. I was always the sister with good common sense. But Tessie was always the one with personality. When she was younger, they all wanted to marry Tessie. Can you believe that Max Tessie Moskowitz had the personality? She was the life of the ghetto, no doubt. She was once a great beauty. Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality. I was a great beauty. How did this personality come about? I was very charming. There were many men interested in you? I was quite a lively dancer. That's very hard to believe. I had a really good day. It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday. Your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey. Yeah, but it's real close. No present till midnight. Oh, you're right. Happy birthday. What is this? Is this a present? Are you kidding? Yeah. Why don't you try one? Yeah. This is more like a present for you. It's been years since our sex life. Uh-huh. Yeah. Forget it. Here's a real present. What? Oh, yeah? What is this anyway? Let me check it out. Let me see. OK. Let's see. Oh, God. Oh, you knew I wanted this. God, it's terrific. God. Just put on the watch and that thing. Oh, God. Oh. Seems like old times Having you to walk with Seems like old times Having you to walk with And it's still a thrill Just to have my arms around you Still the thrill That it was the day I found you Seems like old times Dinner dates and flowers Old times Staying up all hours Making dreams come true Doing things we used to do Seems like old times Here with you Thank you. You were sensational. I mean, you know, I told you that if you stuck to it, you would be great, and you know, you were sensational. Yeah, well, they were just a terrific audience. I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me because I can be written... Excuse me. Oh. Hi, I'm Tony Lacey. Well, hi. We just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your set. Oh, yeah, really? My film's very musical. Very musical. I liked it a lot. Oh, that's really nice. Gosh, thanks a lot. Are you recording? Are you with any label now? Me? No. No, no. Well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime if you get a chance and possibly working together. Well, hey, that's nice. Oh, listen, this is Alvy Senior. Do you know Alvy? No, I don't know, but I know you work on it. Big fan of yours. Thank you very much. This is Sean and Bob and Petronia. Hi, hi, Bob. We're going back to the pier. We're staying at the pier, and we're going to meet Jack and Angelica and have a drink there. And if you'd like to come, we'd love to have you. We can just sit and talk, nothing. Not a big deal. It's just relaxed, just be very mellow. Remember we had that thing? What thing? Don't you remember we discussed that thing that we were... Thing? Yes, we had it. Oh, the thing. Oh, the thing, yeah. Yeah. Oh, well, if it's inconvenient, if you can't do it now, that's fine, too. We'll do it another time. Maybe if you're on the coast, we'll get together and we'll meet there. It was a wonderful set. Oh, gosh. I really enjoyed it. Nice to meet you. Good night. Bye-bye. Bye. Yeah, bye. Bye. What's the matter? What, you wanted to go to that party? I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun. You know, I mean, it would be nice to meet some new people. I'm just not... You know, I don't think I could take a mellow eat because I don't respond well to mellow. You know, I mean, I have a tendency to... If I get too mellow, I ripen and then rot, you know, and it's not good for my... All right, all right, so you don't want to go to the party, so what do you want to do? The war-lovers and Parisian plutocrats wanted to get rid of the suitcases full of gold bars and the other night, you know?","- Alvy? - What? Was there somebody in your room when I called you? - What do you mean? - I mean, I thought I heard a voice. I had the radio on. I'm sorry, it was the television. Let's never break up again.

You knew I wanted this. God, it's terrific! Just put on the watch and that thing. It'll be perfect. Seems like Old times Having you To walk with Seems like Old times Having you to walk with And it's still a thrill Just to have my arms Around you Still the thrill That it was the day I found you Seems like Old times Dinner dates and flowers Old times Staying up all hours Making dreams come true Doing things we used To do Seems like Old times Here with You Thank you. You were sensational. I told you if you stuck to it, you would be great and... You were sensational. Yeah, they were a terrific audience. It makes it easy for me, because I can be... Excuse me. Hi, I'm Tony Lacey. - We wanted to say we enjoyed your set. - Yeah? Really? I thought it was very musical. I liked it a lot. That's really nice. Thanks a lot. Are you recording? Are you with any label? Me? No, not at all. I'd like to talk to you about that sometime if you get a chance. Possibly working together. That's nice. This is Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? I don't, but I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours. This is Shawn, Bob and Petronia. We're going back to the Pierre... and we're going to meet Jack and Angelica for a drink. If you'd like to come, we'd love to have you. We can sit and talk. Not a big deal. Just relax, be very mellow. Remember we had that thing? What thing? Remember we discussed that thing? Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing. Yeah. Well, if it's inconvenient, that's fine, too. We'll do it another time. If you're on the coast, we'll get together there. It was a wonderful set. I really enjoyed it. Nice to have met you. Good night. What's the matter? You want to go to that party? I don't know. I thought it might be fun. It would be nice to meet some new people. I don't think I could take a mellow evening. I don't respond well to mellow. If I get too mellow, I ripen and rot. - It's not good for my... - All right. You don't want to go to the party. What do you want to do? That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember having a good time. - We never have any laughs anymore. - I've been moody and dissatisfied. - How often do you sleep together? - Do you have sex often? Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week. Constantly. I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted sex. She would not sleep with me the other night. I don't know. Six months ago I would have done it just to please him. I tried everything. I put on soft music and my red light bulb. Since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you would have been happy, because I really asserted myself. The incredible thing is, I'm paying for her analysis... she's making progress, and I'm getting screwed."
17," The incredible thing about her is I'm paying for her analysis, and she's making progress, and I'm getting screwed. I don't know, though. I mean, I feel so guilty because Alvie is paying for it, so, you know... So I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. She's making progress, and I'm not making any progress. I don't know. I-I can't win. Sometimes I think... Sometimes I think I should just live with a woman. Wow, I don't believe it. You mean to tell me you guys have never snorted coke? Well, I always wanted to try, you know, but Alvie, he's very down on it. Oh, God, don't put it on me. I don't want to put a wad of white powder in my nose. There's the nasal membranes. You never want to try anything new, Al. How can you say that? I said that you and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a three-some... Well, that's sick. I know it's sick, but it's new. You didn't say it couldn't be sick. Just come on, Alvie. Come on. Do your body a favor. Try it. Come on. Yeah, come on. It'll be fun. It's a lot of fun, because the Inkas did it, you know, and there were a million laughs. Alvie, come on, for your own experience. You want to write? What happened? It's great stuff, Alvie. A friend of mine just brought it in from California. Oh, you know something? I didn't tell you. We're going to California next week. Oh, really? I'm thrilled, as you know. Yeah. On my agent's advice, I sold out, and I'm going to do an appearance on a TV show. No, no, that's not at all. Alvie's giving an award on television. Geez, you guys are violating a moral issue. It's so phony, and we have to leave New York Listen, while you're in California, could you possibly score some coke for me? Oh, sure, I'd be glad to. I'll just put it on a hollow heel that I have on my boot. You know? How much is this stuff? That's about $2,000 an ounce. Really? What is the kick of it? I never... We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas I've never been so relaxed as I have been since I moved out here, Max. I want you to see my house. I live right next to Hugh Hefner's house, Max. That's me as the jacuzzi. And the women, Max, they're like the women in Playboy magazine only they can move their arms and legs. You know, I can't get over that this is really Beverly Hills. The architecture's really consistent, isn't it? There's French next to Spanish, next to Tudor, next to Japanese. God, it's so clean out here. It's because they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows. Come on, Max, give us a break, will you? It's Christmas. Can you believe this is Christmas? You know, it was snowing and really gray in New York, naturally. You're kidding. Santa Claus will have sun struck. Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging. There's no economic crime, you know, but there's ritual, religious cult murders. You know, there's wheat germ killers out here. While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party. Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray Now, Charlie, give me a good laugh here. The limousine to the track breakdown? A little bigger. Max, do you realize how immoral this all is? Max, I got a head series. I know, but you're adding fake laughs. ...home so early. Arnie, let me see your breakdown. Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie. You can do the show live in front of an audience. Right, but nobody laughs in it, because the jokes aren't funny. Yeah, well, that's where this machine is dying in. Arnie, you better lie down. You've been in the sun too long. Yeah, now give me like a medium-sized chuckle here. And then a big hand. Is there booing on that? You can do it, Will. Oh, Max. We were just going to pick you up with my cousin Dolores. What's the matter? I don't know. I just got very dizzy. I'm marrying Dolores. I feel dizzy, Max. Sit down. Oh, Jesus. He's marrying Dolores. Are you all right? I don't know. You want to lie down? No, no. You know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just suddenly got high. How about a ginger ale? Oh, Max, no. Maybe I better lie down. Why don't you just try to get a little of this down? Is it just plain chicken? No, I can't eat this. I'm nauseous. If you can just get me something to get me through the next two hours, you know, I have to go out to Burbank and give out an award on a TV show. There's nothing wrong with you, actually, so far as I can tell. I mean, you have no fever, no symptoms of anything serious. You haven't been eating pork or shellfish. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, doctor. Alvie, Alvie, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you. Oh, Jesus. Now I don't get to do the TV show. I'm going to have to go to the hospital. I'm just saying I can't find anything. Nothing at all? No, I think I could get a lab man. I'm a salt man. Excuse me. Perhaps it would be even better if we took him to the hospital for a day or two. Hospital? Well, otherwise there's no real way to tell what's going on. Not bad, actually. Hey, don't tell me we're going to have to walk from the car to the house. Geez, my feet haven't touched the ground yet. I'm going to have to walk. I'm going to have to walk from the car to the house. Geez, my feet haven't touched pavement since I reached Los Angeles. Well, you take a meeting with him. I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy. I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him. All the good meetings are taken. Right now it's only a notion. But I think I can get money to make it into a concert and then later turn it into an idea. Like this house, Max? Mm-hmm. You even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom. You should have told me it was Tony Lacey's party. What do you think? I think he has a little thing for Annie. No, no, no, unfortunately, Max. He goes with that girl over there. Where? The one with the VPL. VPL? The Visible Panty Line. Max, she's gorgeous. Yeah, she's a 10, Max. That's great for you because you're used to twos, aren't you? I'm not used to twos, Max. Yeah, you're used to the kind with the shopping bags, walking through Central Toss with the surgical masks on and muttering. I like this couple, Max. I look like they just came back from Masters and Shots. Yeah, intensive care would. My God. My God. Hey, Max, I think she's giving me the eye. She comes over here, Max. My brain's going to walk a mile. Handle it, handle it. Hi. You're Albie Singer, right? Do you mean it, Est? Est? No, no, no. I was never too Est. How can you criticize him? Oh, he didn't say anything. No, no, no. I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... Here's my food taster. Have you two met? Hey, how do you do? Do you taste to see if the food's poisoned? Yeah, he's great. You guys are wearing white. It must be in the stars. Yuri Geller must be on the premises someplace. We're going to operate together. We just need about six weeks, and in about six weeks we could cut the whole album. I don't know, this is a strange thing to do. You can come and stay here. No. There's a whole wing in this house. Oh, yeah, stay here? Uh-huh. Really, why are you smiling? I don't know, I don't know. Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meaning. Mm. This is a great house, really, everything. Saunas, jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here? Trigger. Charlie Chaplin. Hey. Right before his own American thing. Yeah, that's good. But you guys are still, uh, you're still in New York, this. Yeah, I love it there. Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years, you know, but it's gotten, it's so dirty now. I'm into garbage, it's my thing. Well, this is really nice screening room. It's really nice, don't you? Well, and there's another thing about New York. See, if you want to see a movie, you have to stand on line, it could be freezing, it could be raining, and here, you're just... You saw Grand Illusion here last night. Hey, that's a great film if you're high. It's really funny. Come and see our bedroom. We did a fantastic thing. Thanks, ma'am. Oh, good, okay. I'm cool. It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just eat and they watch movies all day? Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know, it's important to make a little effort once in a while. You think his girlfriend's beautiful? Yeah, she's great-looking, great. Little Ted on the androgynous side, but stainless. I forgot my mantra. That was fun. I don't think California's bad at all. It's a drag coming home. A lot of beautiful women. It was fun to flirt. I have to face facts. I adore Albie, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore. I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. What do I need this? If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him. If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest. Albie, let's face it. You know, I don't think our relationship is working. I know. A relationship, I think, is like a shark. It has to constantly move forward or it dies. And I think what we got on our hands is a dead shark. Who's catching the riot, sister? Well, let's see now. If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine. Sure has. You wrote your name in all the books. You knew this day was going to come. Well, Albie, you wanted to break up just as much as I do. No question about it. I think we're doing the mature thing without any doubt. Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours, and all the poetry books are mine. It's Denial of Death. Remember this, the first book that I got you? Oh, God. Remember that day? Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. Thanks, Annie. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no. I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that. There's no question about that, because we've given this, I think, a more than fair shot, you know. Yeah, my analyst thinks this movie's a good movie.","So I feel guilty if I don't sleep with him.

My analyst thinks this move is key for me. And I trust her, because my analyst recommended her. Why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?"
18," Yeah, and I, uh, you know, I trust it, because my analyst recommended her. Why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups, anyway? Right, and you know what the beauty part is? That we can always come back together again. Exactly. There's no problem. Right, you know, I don't think many couples could handle us. They could just break up and remain friends. Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, remember? I guess these are all yours. And Peach Eisenhower and Peach Nixon and Peach Lyndon Johnson and Peach Donald Reagan. Mr. Reagan. Hi, Miss Annie. I made a terrible mistake. She's living in Los Angeles with Tony Lacey. Oh, yeah? Well, if she is, then to hell with her. If she likes that lifestyle, let her live there. He's a jerk, for one thing. You graduated Harvard? Yeah, you may... Listen, Harvard makes mistakes, too, you know. Kissinger taught there. Don't tell me you're jealous. Yeah, jealous a little bit, like Madea. Let me... Can I show you something, lady? I have here... I found this in the apartment. Black soap. She used to wash her face 800 times a day with black soap. Don't ask me why. Why don't you go out with other women? Well, I tried, but it's... You know, it's very depressing. This always happens to me. Quick, get a broom. What are you making such a big deal about? They're only lobsters. If you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster. I'm not myself since I stopped smoking. Oh, when did you quit smoking? 16 years ago. What do you mean? What do you mean? Mean? You stopped smoking 16 years ago. Is that what you said? I don't understand. Are you joking or what? Central Park's turning green. Yeah, I saw that lunatic that we used to see with the pinwheel hat and the roller skates. Listen, I want you to come back here. Well, then I'm going to come out there and get you. What do you mean, where am I? Where do you think I am? I'm at the Los Angeles airport. I flew in. Well, I flew in to see you. Hey, listen, can we not debate this on the telephone? Because I feel that I've got a temperature and I'm getting my chronic Los Angeles nausea ready. I don't feel so good. Well, wherever you want to meet, I don't care. I'll drive in. I rented a car. I'm driving. What is that, such a miracle? I'm driving myself. I'm going to have the alfalfa sprouts and a plate of mashed yeast. Hi. I'm going to have the alfalfa sprouts and a plate of mashed yeast. You look very pretty. Oh, no, I just lost the weight, that's all. Well, you look nice. I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married. Oh, Albie, come on. Boy, you want to live out here all you say? It's like living in munchkin land. What do you mean? It's perfectly fine out here. Tony's very nice. I meet people and I go to parties and we play tennis. That's a very big step for me. I'm able to enjoy people more. What do you want? You're not going to come back to New York? What's so great about New York? It's a dying city. You read Death in Venice. You didn't read Death in Venice till I bought it for you. That's right. It's not about the books with the word Death in the title. That's right, because it's an important issue. Albie, you're incapable of enjoying life. You know that? You're like New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself. I can't enjoy anything unless everybody is. If one guy is starving someplace, that puts a crimp in my evening. So you want to get married or what? No. I want to be friends. I want to remain friends. Jack, please. You're mad, aren't you? Yes, of course I'm mad. Because you love me. I know that. Albie, I can't say that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. You know how wonderful you are. You're the reason that I got out of my room and that I was able to sing and get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't want... Listen, listen, listen. Um... So what are you up to anyway, huh? As usual. You know, I'm trying to write and working on a play. So what are you saying? That you're not coming back to New York with me? No, look. I gotta go. What do you mean? I flew 3,000 miles to see you. 3,000 miles? You know what that does to my stomach? You must know it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammy's are tonight. The what? The Grammy's. He's got a lot of records up for awards. Really? They give awards for that kind of music? I thought just earplugs. Just forget it, Albie, okay? Let's just forget the conversation. Awards. They do nothing but give out awards. I can't believe it. Greatest, greatest fascist dictator, Adolf Hitler. Don't mind me, man. No Abbas, right? No. I'll see you all around New York. Sure. All right, what would you like to eat? Bal Smoke? Smoke? Don't get angry or anything, because I have my license here. You know, it's a rented car, and I... I... I... Don't give me your license. Dory, just pick up the license. Oh, pick up the license. You have to ask nicely, because I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girlfriend... Just give me the license, please. Since you put it that way, it's hard for me to refuse. I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. It's not your fault. Don't take it personal. I'll see you around. So long, fellas. Keep in touch. Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max. Yeah, I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing. Twins, Max. 16-year-old. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities of that? You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park. Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard II, and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotards. Max, are we driving through plutonium? Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old. You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle? What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city. You read Death in Venice. You didn't read Death in Venice till I gave it to you. You only give me books with the word death in the title. It's an important issue. Artie, you are totally incapable of enjoying life. You're like New York. You're an island. Okay. If that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all. You know what's funny? After all the serious talks and passionate moments, that it ends here, in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sally. Wait. I'm gonna go with you. I love you. What do you want? It was my first play. You know how you're always trying to get things to come out perfect in art, because it's real difficult in life. Interestingly, however, I did run into Annie again. It was on the upper west side of Manhattan. She had moved back to New York. She was living in Soho with some guy. And when I met her, she was, of all things, dragging him in to see The Sorrow and the Pity, which I counted as a personal triumph. And Annie and I, we had lunch sometime after that, and just kicked around old times. Just to have my arms around you Still the thrill that it was the day I saw you","- There's no problem. - Exactly. I don't think many couples could handle this, break up and remain friends. This button is mine. Remember? These are yours. Impeach Eisenhower. Impeach Nixon. Impeach Lyndon Johnson. Impeach Ronald Reagan. I miss Annie. I made a terrible mistake. She's living in Los Angeles with Tony Lacey. If she is, then the hell with her. If she likes that lifestyle, let her stay. - He's a jerk for one thing. - He graduated Harvard. Harvard makes mistakes, too. Kissinger taught there. Don't tell me you're jealous? Yeah. Jealous? A little bit. Like Medea. Can I show you something? I found this in the apartment. Black soap. She used to wash her face 800 times a day with black soap. Don't ask me why. Why don't you go out with other women? I tried, but it's very depressing. This always happens to me. Quick! Get a broom! What are you making such a big deal about? They're only lobsters. - You're adult. You can pick up lobsters. - I'm not myself since I quit smoking. - When did you quit? - Sixteen years ago. - What do you mean? - Mean? You stopped smoking 16 years ago. Is that what you said? I don't understand. Are you joking or what? Central Park's turning green. I saw that lunatic we used to see with the pinwheel hat... and the roller-skates. Listen, I want you to come back here. Well, then I'm going to come out there and get you. What do you mean, where am I? Where do you think I am? I'm at the Los Angeles airport. I flew in. I flew in to see you. Can we not debate this on the telephone... because I've got a temperature... and I'm getting my chronic Los Angeles nausea again. and I'm getting my chronic Los Angeles nausea again. Wherever you want to meet. I don't care. I'll drive in. I rented a car. I'm driving. What, is that such a miracle? I'm driving myself. I'm going to have the alfalfa sprouts... and a plate of mashed yeast. You look pretty. No, I just lost a little weight, that's all. Well, you look nice. I think we should get married. Come on. Why, you want to live out here? It's like living in Munchkinland. What do you mean? It's perfectly fine out here. Tony's very nice. I meet people, go to parties and play tennis. That's a very big step for me. I'm able to enjoy people more. You're not going to come back to New York? What's so great about New York? It's a dying city. You read Death in Venice. You didn't read Death in Venice until I bought it for you. That's right. You only gave me books with the word death in the title. Because it's an important issue. You're incapable of enjoying life. You know that? You're like New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself. I can't enjoy anything unless everybody is. If one guy is starving someplace, it puts a crimp in my evening. Do you want to get married? No. We're friends. I want to remain friends. Check please. You're mad, aren't you? Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me. I know that. I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really can't say that's true. You know how wonderful you are. You're the reason I got out of my room, that I was able to sing... and get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Listen, listen. So what are you up to? The usual. I'm trying to write. I'm working on a play. Are you saying you're not coming back to New York with me? No. Look. I gotta go. What do you mean? I flew 3,000 miles to see you. Air miles. Do you know what that does to my stomach? If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. - The Grammys are tonight. - The what? The Grammys. He's got a lot of records up for awards. They give awards for that music? I thought just ear plugs. Just forget it. Let's just forget the conversation. They do nothing but give out awards. I can't believe it. Greatest Fascist Dictator: Adolph Hitler. I know what you're going to say. I'm not a great driver. - I have some problems with... - May I see your license, please? Just don't get angry. I have my license here. It's a rented car. Don't give me your life's story. Just pick up the license. You have to ask nicely, because I've had a rough day. My girlfriend... Just give me the license, please. Since you put it that way, it's hard for me to refuse. I have a terrific problem with authority. It's not your fault. Don't take it personal. So long, fellows. Keep in touch. Imagine my surprise when I got your call. Yeah. I had the feeling I got you at a bad moment. I heard high-pitched squealing. Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities of that? You're an actor. You should be doing Shakespeare in the park. I did Shakespeare in the park. I got mugged. I was playing Richard II. Two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard. Are we driving through plutonium? Keeps out the alpha rays. You don't get old. You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle? What is so great about New York? It's a dying city. You read Death in Venice. You didn't read Death in Venice until I gave it to you. You only give me books with the word death in the title. - It's an important issue. - You're incapable of enjoying life. You're like New York. You're an island. Okay. If that's all that we've been through together means to you... it's better if we just said good-bye, once and for all. It's funny. After all the serious talks and passionate moments... that it ends here, in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Good-bye, Sally. Wait. I'm going to go with you. I love you. What do you want? It was my first play. You know how you're always trying to get things to come out perfect in art... because it's real difficult in life. Interestingly, however, I did run into Annie again. It was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She had moved back to New York. She was living in Soho with some guy. When I met her, she was dragging him in to see The Sorrow and the Pity... which I counted as a personal triumph. Annie and I had lunch sometime after that... and just kicked around old times. Just to have my arms Around you Still the thrill That it was the day I found you Seems like"
19, I've found you seems like Old times Dinner dates and flowers Old times Old times You You You You You You,"Dinner dates and flowers Old times After that, it got late and we both had to go. But it was great seeing Annie again. I realize what a terrific person she was... and how much fun it was just knowing her. And I thought of that old joke. This guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, Doc, my brother's crazy. He thinks he's a chicken. The doctor says, Why don't you turn him in? The guy says, I would, but I need the eggs. Well, I guess that's, now, how I feel about relationships. They're totally irrational, crazy and absurd. But I guess we keep going through it... because most of us need the eggs."
